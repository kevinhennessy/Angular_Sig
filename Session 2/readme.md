# Session 2 - Routing, Forms

Slides for the session can be found at [kevinhennessy.github.io/angular2/Session2](http://kevinhennessy.github.io/angular2/Session2)

In this session we will be working with a series of checkpoints for Chapter 4 of the book.The starting repository for the book chapter Checkpoint 4.1 which is located at [github.com/chandermani/angular2byexample/tree/checkpoint4.1](https://github.com/chandermani/angular2byexample/tree/checkpoint4.1). 

## Pre-reqs
This session assumes you have read chapter 4 of the book.

## Getting set up with Personal Trainer
[David]
## Routing
### Essentials
[David]
### Getting Started
In this section, we will be starting with Checkpoint 4.1
which introduces the following:
* Sharing the workout model as a service
* Personal trainer layout
* Adding skeleton files for each component
* Personal trainer navigation with routes
* Code changes:
### Child Routing
In this section we'll be adding the code for child routes. The finished version is at Checkpoint 4.2
#### Adding the child routing component
* In the workout-builder directory, add a new TypeScript file named workout-builder.routes.ts.
* Then add the with the following imports to that file: 
```javascript
import { ModuleWithProviders } from '@angular/core'; 
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

import { WorkoutBuilderComponent}  from "./workout-builder.component"; 
import { ExerciseComponent} from './exercise/exercise.component'; 
import { ExercisesComponent} from './exercises/exercises.component'; 
import { WorkoutComponent} from './workout/workout.component'; 
import { WorkoutsComponent} from './workouts/workouts.component';
``` 
* Next add the following route configuration below the imports:
```javascript
export const workoutBuilderRoutes: Routes = [
    {
        path: 'builder',
        component: WorkoutBuilderComponent,
        children: [
             {path:'', pathMatch: 'full', redirectTo: 'workouts'},
             {path:'workouts', component: WorkoutsComponent },
             {path:'workout/new',  component: WorkoutComponent },
             {path:'workout/:id', component: WorkoutComponent },
             {path:'exercises', component: ExercisesComponent},
             {path:'exercise/new', component: ExerciseComponent },
             {path:'exercise/:id', component: ExerciseComponent }
        ]
    }
];
```
* Finally, add the following export statement:
```javascript
export const workoutBuilderRouting: ModuleWithProviders = RouterModule.forChild(workoutBuilderRoutes);
```
#### Updating the WorkoutBuilder Component to support child routes
We next need to update the WorkoutBuilder component to support our new child routes. To do so change the @Component decorator for Workout Builder to: 
* remove the selector,  
* replace the reference to a templateUrl with a template reference, 
* add a <sub-nav> custom element to the template, and  
* add a <router-outlet> tag to the template.

The decorator should now look like the following: 
```javascript
@Component({ 
    template: `<div class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top second-top-nav"> 
                  <sub-nav></sub-nav> 
               </div> 
               <div class="container body-content app-container"> 
                  <router-outlet></router-outlet> 
               </div>` 
})
```  
#### Updating the WorkoutBuilder module to make it a feature module
* Update the imports in workout-builder.module.ts to the following:
```javascript
import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

import { ExerciseComponent } from "./exercise/exercise.component";
import { ExercisesComponent } from "./exercises/exercises.component";
import { LeftNavExercisesComponent } from "./navigation/left-nav-exercises.component";
import { LeftNavMainComponent } from "./navigation/left-nav-main.component";
import { SubNavComponent} from './navigation/sub-nav.component';
import { WorkoutBuilderComponent } from "./workout-builder.component";
import { WorkoutComponent } from "./workout/workout.component";
import { WorkoutsComponent } from "./workouts/workouts.component";

import { workoutBuilderRouting } from './workout-builder.routes';
```
* Next update the @NgModule decoratore to the following:
```javascript
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        CommonModule,
        workoutBuilderRouting
    ],
    declarations: [
        WorkoutBuilderComponent,
        WorkoutComponent,
        WorkoutsComponent,
        ExerciseComponent,
        ExercisesComponent,
        SubNavComponent,
        LeftNavExercisesComponent,
        LeftNavMainComponent
    ],
    exports: [WorkoutBuilderComponent],
})
```

#### Updating app.routes to remove the workout builder component and its route from that file.
Finally, go back to app.routes.ts and remove the import of the WorkoutBuilderComponent and its route.
### Lazy Loading
In this section we'll be adding the code for lazy loading. The finished version is at Checkpoint 4.3.
* First, modify app.routes.ts to add the following separate route configuration under the existing imports:
```javascript
const workoutBuilderRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'builder',
    loadChildren: 'dist/components/workout-builder/workout-builder.module#WorkoutBuilderModule'
  }
];
```
* Next update the Routes configuration to the following:
```javascript
export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'start', component: StartComponent },
  { path: 'workout', component: WorkoutContainerCompnent },
  { path: 'finish', component: FinishComponent },
  { path: 'history', component: WorkoutHistoryComponent },
    ...workoutBuilderRoutes,
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/start' }
];
```
* Then go back to workout-builder.routes.ts and change the path property to an empty string:
```javascript
export const workoutBuilderRoutes: Routes = [ 
    { 
        path: '', 
. . . 
    } 
];
```
* Finally go back to the app-module.ts and remove the WorkoutBuilderModule import in the @NgModule configuration in that file.
## Forms
### Template Driven Forms
[Kumanan]
### Model Driven Forms
#### Getting Started
* To get started, open workout-builder.module.ts and add an import for the ReactiveFormsModule:
```javascript 
import { FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule }   from '@angular/forms'; 
 ... 
@NgModule({ 
    imports: [ 
        CommonModule, 
        FormsModule, 
        ReactiveFormsModule, 
        SharedModule, 
        workoutBuilderRouting 
    ],
```
* Next copy exercise-builder-service.ts from the workout-builder/builder-services folder under trainer/src/components in checkpoint 4.6. and import it into workout-builder.module.ts:
```javascript 
import { ExerciseBuilderService } from "./builder-services/exercise-builder-service";
``` 
* Then add it as an additional provider to the providers array in that same file:
```javascript 
@NgModule({ 
 . . . 
    providers: [ 
        ExerciseBuilderService, 
        ExerciseGuard, 
        WorkoutBuilderService, 
        WorkoutGuard 
    ] 
})
```
You will notice here that we also have added ExerciseGuard as a provider. We won’t be covering that here, but you should copy it from the exercise folder as well and also copy the updated workout-builder.routes.ts that adds that as a route guard for the navigation to the ExerciseComponent
* Now open exercise.component.ts and add the following import statements at the top of the file:
```javascript 
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { Validators, FormArray, FormGroup, FormControl, FormBuilder } from '@angular/forms';

import { ExerciseBuilderService } from "../builder-services/exercise-builder-service";
import { AlphaNumericValidator } from "../alphanumeric-validator";
import { Exercise} from "../../../services/model";
```
* Then inject the FormBuilder as well as the (as well as the Router, ActivatedRoute and the ExerciseBuilderService) into the constructor of our class:
```javascript 
constructor( 
    public route: ActivatedRoute, 
    public router: Router, 
    public exerciseBuilderService:ExerciseBuilderService, 
    public formBuilder: FormBuilder 
){}
```     
#### Using the FormBuilder API
* Go ahead and add the ngOnInit lifecycle hook to our class as follows:
```javascript 
ngOnInit():any{ 
    this.sub = this.route.params.subscribe(params => { 
        let exerciseName = params['id']; 
        if (exerciseName === 'new') { 
            exerciseName = ""; 
        } 
        this.exercise = this.exerciseBuilderService.startBuilding(exerciseName); 
    }); 
    this.buildExerciseForm(); 
} 
```
*Now let’s implement the buildExerciseForm method by adding the following code:
```javascript 
buildExerciseForm(){ 
    this.exerciseForm = this.formBuilder.group({ 
        'name': [this.exercise.name, [Validators.required, AlphaNumericValidator.invalidAlphaNumeric]], 
        'title': [this.exercise.title, Validators.required], 
        'description': [this.exercise.description, Validators.required], 
        'image': [this.exercise.image, Validators.required], 
        'nameSound': [this.exercise.nameSound], 
        'procedure': [this.exercise.procedure], 
        'videos': this.addVideoArray() 
    }) 
}
```
* to construct this new FormArray, add the following addVideoArray method to our class:
```javascript 
addVideoArray(){ 
    if(this.exercise.videos){ 
        this.exercise.videos.forEach((video : any) => { 
            this.videoArray.push(new FormControl(video, Validators.required)); 
        }); 
    } 
    return this.videoArray; 
}
```
#### Adding the Form Model to our HTML View
Copy in the code for exercise.component.html from checkpoint 4.6.
Notice the form tag: 
```javascript
<form [formGroup]="exerciseForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(exerciseForm)" novalidate>
```
#### Adding Form Controls to our Form inputs
```javascript
<input name="name" formControlName="name" class="form-control" id="name" placeholder="Enter exercise name. Must be unique.">  
``` 
#### Adding Validation
```javascript
<label *ngIf="exerciseForm.controls.name.hasError('required') && (exerciseForm.controls.name.touched || submitted)" class="alert alert-danger validation-message">Name is required</label> 
```
### Adding Dynamic Form Controls
We first use ngFor to loop through our list of videos. Then we add assign the index in our videos to a local variable i. No surprises so far.
```javascript  
<div *ngFor="let video of videoArray.controls; let i=index" class="form-group">
```  
Inside the loop we do three things. First, we add a button to allow the user to delete a video:
```javascript 
<button type="button" (click)="deleteVideo(i)" title="Delete this video." class="btn alert-danger pull-right"> 
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash text-danger"></span> 
</button>
```  
We bind a deleteVideo method in our component class to the button’s click event and pass it the index of the video being deleted. 
Next we dynamically add a video input field for each of the videos currently in our exercise:
```javascript 
<input type="text" class="form-control" [formControlName]="i" placeholder="Add a related youtube video identified."/>
``` 
We then add a validation message for each of the video input fields
```javascript 
<label *ngIf="exerciseForm.controls['videos'].controls[i].hasError('required') && (exerciseForm.controls['videos'].controls[i].touched || submitted)" class="alert alert-danger validation-message">Video identifier is required</label>
```
#### Saving the form
we bound the ngSubmit event to the following onSubmit method in our code:
```javascript 
onSubmit(formExercise:FormGroup){ 
    this.submitted = true; 
    if (!formExercise.valid) return; 
    this.mapFormValues(formExercise); 
    this.exerciseBuilderService.save(); 
    this.router.navigate(['/builder/exercises']); 
} 
``` 
then it calls the following mapFormValues method, which assigns the values from our form to the exercise that will be saved:
```javascript 
mapFormValues(form: FormGroup){ 
    this.exercise.name = form.controls['name'].value; 
    this.exercise.title = form.controls['title'].value; 
    this.exercise.description = form.controls['description'].value; 
    this.exercise.image = form.controls['image'].value; 
    this.exercise.nameSound = form.controls['nameSound'].value; 
    this.exercise.procedure = form.controls['procedure'].value; 
    this.exercise.videos = form.controls['videos'].value; 
} 
```
#### Custom validators
So let’s start by adding a TypeScript file with the name alphanumeric-validator.ts. In that file first import FormControl from @angular/forms, then add the following class to that file:
```javascript 
export class AlphaNumericValidator { 
    static invalidAlphaNumeric(control: FormControl):{ [key:string]:boolean } { 
        if ( control.value.length && !control.value.match(/^[a-z0-9]+$/i) ){ 
            return {invalidAlphaNumeric: true }; 
        } 
        return null; 
    } 
} 
```
Open workout.component.html and add the following label just below the label that displays the message for the required validator:
```javascript
<label *ngIf="exerciseForm.controls.name.hasError('invalidAlphaNumeric') && (exerciseForm.controls.name.touched || submitted)" class="alert alert-danger validation-message">Name must be alphanumeric</label>
```
