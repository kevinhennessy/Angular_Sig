### Personal Trainer
7 Minute Workout is an exercise/workout plan that requires us to perform a set of twelve exercises in quick succession within the seven minute time span. 7 Minute Workout has become quite popular due to its benefits and the short duration of the workout. We cannot confirm or refute the claims but doing any form of strenuous physical activity is better than doing nothing at all. If you are interested to know more about the workout, then check out [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/).
